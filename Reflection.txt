First of all I created a table named SportyCars in oracle database and inserted relevant data
Then, I created a class to connect to my database and to create XML file from a table called Sporty cars in database.
After that, when my java code gave me the XML file, I wrote the XSL file based on the rules which are mentioned in PDF java notes.
First I implemented some style for the table. then,I wrote a for each to do looping in XML file and also I used value of to extract the value of selected node. 
After which, I just run the XmlStylizer to get my HTML file.
Then I created a class to read my XML file. I read a file and parse if with an event base interface called SAX.
At the end I opened a note pad and create my json array and saved file as json and uploaded it on public folder in matrix account.
Then, I created a class to read the json file from matrix.
